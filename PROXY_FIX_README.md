# 🔧 Gork Backrooms 404 Fix

## Issue Identified
The frontend is getting a 404 error when trying to reach `/api/gork/chat` because the React development server doesn't know where to proxy API requests.

## Solution Applied
✅ Added proxy configuration to `client/package.json`:
```json
"proxy": "http://localhost:3001"
```

## ⚠️ RESTART REQUIRED

You need to **restart the React development server** for the proxy to take effect:

### Option 1: Restart Everything
```bash
# Stop current servers (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart both:
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Just Restart React (if backend is running)
```bash
# In a new terminal window:
cd client
npm start
```

### Option 3: PowerShell Commands
```powershell
# Stop the React dev server process
# Find the process using port 3000:
Get-Process -Name node | Where-Object {$_.StartInfo.Arguments -like "*3000*"}

# Or restart everything:
npm run dev
```

## ✅ Verification

After restarting, test that the proxy works:
```bash
# This should now return Gork's status (not 404):
curl http://localhost:3000/api/gork/status
```

## Why This Happened

- Backend was working perfectly ✅
- React dev server (port 3000) didn't know where to send `/api/*` requests ❌
- Added proxy config to forward all API requests to backend (port 3001) ✅

## After Restart

The Gork Backrooms should work perfectly:
- ✅ Chat with Gork
- ✅ Dynamic video backgrounds  
- ✅ Audio generation (when API keys added)
- ✅ Full immersive experience

**Simply restart your dev server and the 404 error will be fixed! 🌀**
